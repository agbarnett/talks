## Ethical guidance on study designs

<!-- to do: highlight new wording -->

::: incremental
* **National statement**: “Research that has merit is: [...] designed or developed using methods appropriate for achieving the aims of the proposal.”

* **Declaration of Helsinki**: "Medical research involving human participants must have a scientifically sound and rigorous design and execution that are likely to produce reliable, valid, and valuable knowledge and avoid research waste."

## Our study design

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
* Census of all human committees in Australia registered with the NHMRC, not animal

* Focus on research using quantitative data and/or analysis, not qualitative research

* Online questionnaire

* Protocol published on _Open Science Framework_

## Practical strategies{background-color='black'}

<!-- "The theme of this year’s conference is practical strategies. If you could include at the end of your talk a slide to sum up how HREC members can apply the subject area of your talk to when reviewing an ethics application, it would be of great benefit to the audience." -->

:::{.column width="75%"}

:::: incremental
* Should committees cover study design? Each committee makes a public statement

<!-- * Committees claiming to examine study design should provide the name(s) of the statistician(s) and their qualifications -->

* Trials only approved if the trial team contains methodological and statistical expertise

<!-- From: 10.1186/s13063-022-06415-5 -->

* Get access to **qualified** statistical expertise

* Pay all members

<!-- “too much” focus on ethics considerations, such as consenting processes, partly because these can be easier to judge than the science? -->
