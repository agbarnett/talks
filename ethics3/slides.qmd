## Ethical guidance on study designs

<!-- to do: highlight new wording -->

::: incremental
* **National statement**: “Research that has merit is: [...] designed or developed using methods appropriate for achieving the aims of the proposal.”

* **Declaration of Helsinki**: "Medical research involving human participants must have a scientifically sound and rigorous design and execution that are likely to produce reliable, valid, and valuable knowledge and avoid research waste."
:::

## Design

* Tried to contact all human committees in Australia registered with the NHMRC, not animal

* Focus on quantitative research using data, not qualitative research

* Published a protocol on _Open Science Framework_

## Hard to find

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}
* Hard to find contact details for many HRECs

* Some committees appear inactive

## results

Only 24% of committees had a statistician as a full member.
• Willingness to take statistical advice from researchers without statistical qualifications.
• Some committees do not examine methods.

To do: show graph of results with slow release...

# show change in results after confirming quals

## Practical strategies

<!-- "The theme of this year’s conference is practical strategies. If you could include at the end of your talk a slide to sum up how HREC members can apply the subject area of your talk to when reviewing an ethics application, it would be of great benefit to the audience." -->


## ?

“too much” focus on ethics considerations, such as consenting processes, partly because these can be easier to judge than the science?
