## Conflicts of interest

We are statisticians and all members of the Statistical Society of Australia.

## Statistics is praticed badly

![](figures/)

## National statement

<!-- to do: highlight new wording -->

applications to human committees should detail how the study is
“designed or developed using methods appropriate for achieving the aims of the proposal”

Also add declaration of Helsinki change ...

## Interesting change to the Declaration of Helsinki

"Medical research involving human participants must have a scientifically sound and rigorous design and execution that are likely to produce reliable, valid, and valuable knowledge and avoid research waste."

## Design

Tried to contact all human committees in Australia registered with the NHMRC, not animal

Focus on quantitative research using data, not qualitative

## Hard to find

Hard to find contact details, some very old. Some committees seem inactive. 

Flow chart.

## ?

“too much” focus on ethics considerations, such as consenting processes, partly because these can be easier to judge than the science?

## results
Only 24% of committees had a statistician as a full member.
• Willingness to take statistical advice from researchers without statistical qualifications.
• Some committees do not examine methods.

To do: show graph of results with slow release...

# show change in results after confirming quals

## Practical strategies

<!-- "The theme of this year’s conference is practical strategies. If you could include at the end of your talk a slide to sum up how HREC members can apply the subject area of your talk to when reviewing an ethics application, it would be of great benefit to the audience." -->
