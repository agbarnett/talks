# Externalising costs 

.pull-left[
* 650 applicants and 6 awards; success < 1%

* Total prize = $900,000 ($150,000 per winner)

* Prize would be wiped out if each applicant spent 7 days on their application

# A modified lottery

### 1. Applicants are reviewed to ensure they fit the goals of the scheme

--

### 2. Eligible applicants awarded at random until funding runs out

.pull-right[

* 63% in favour of using lottery, 25% against

* Provided those applications that made it through the initial stage were “of equal merit”, “deemed worthy enough”

* “I don't think a randomisation process is any less fair than an individual reviewer finding some minor reason for a great project not to be funded.”

# Arguments against using a modified lottery

.pull-left[

Rewards less deserving and/or less enthusiastic

Encourages less talented to apply

Applicants put in less effort

Still requires peer review

# Potential benefits for scientific societies

.pull-left[

Reduces cronyism (and perception of cronyism)

Increases diversity in winners

Reduces application and review costs

Acknowledges that science is unpredictable

--

Reduces stigma of failure

Might reduce "Matthew effect"

--

Creates a perfect randomised trial of funding

# Alterations

.pull-left[

1. Golden ticket: "outstanding" applications skip the lottery

2. Weighted lotteries: some applicants get more tickets than others

3. Stratified lotteries: e.g., winners at least 50% women

# Worthwhile data

.pull-left[

### Ask applicants:

### 1. How long they spent on their application

### 2. What system they would prefer
