# AIMOS conference, November 2024

Title: What should AIMOS do next?

Abstract: AIMOS was founded in June 2019. In our first five years, we have been an active scholarly society and have advanced the field of meta-research. This discussion group aims to gather your thoughts and ideas for what AIMOS should do in the next two years. Some potential goals are to: Improve our finances and sustainability, Increase membership, Increase our profile and influence, Run an annual conference. Are there other important goals? What actions should we take to achieve these goals? Should we pursue deductible gift recipient status? Should we raise our profile in the global south? How can we best balance these ideas against our limited resources? This discussion forum will be a great opportunity for our community to shape the future of AIMOS. I will start with a brief outline of our previous activities, member numbers and spread, and financial status. Please share your ideas for how AIMOS can continue to be an active society that improves the quality of research.
