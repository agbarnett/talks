# A common misconception

"It is widely but incorrectly believed that the t-test and linear regression are valid only for Normally distributed outcomes. This belief leads to the use of rank tests for which confidence intervals are very hard to obtain and interpret and to cumbersome data-dependent procedures where different transformations are examined until a distributional test fails to reject Normality."


We only need to worry about **extreme** non-Normality

## Don't use matching

.pull-left[

Matching is a very strong assumption, needs a very strong match

Widely applied inappropriately to match patients and hence eliminate confounding 

Can easily create selection biases

Often reduces power
