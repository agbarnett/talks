# International Statistical Institute (ISI) Regional Seminar Series

*Topic*: Access to health data is essential for statisticians to provide insights and create policy advice. For example, we might examine data on presentations to an emergency department for elderly patients over many years and then examine if there was a change in outcomes after the introduction of a new ED staff member dedicated to elderly patients. We can use routine data to examine important things like how long they spent in hospital, if they went home, and if they came back again to hospital within a few days. Analyses like these can directly inform the key decision of the benefits of adding that staff member. They can tell decision makers whether adding this staff member at other hospitals is likely to be a good idea. There's a wealth of these data that are routinely collected by hospitals and contain very little personal information. For the real example I've given, it's very unlikely that I could deduce anything about any individual, even if I wanted to. 

Unfortunately, negotiating data access for this type of routinely collected health data is a long process that often ends in failure. For example, this year I've been involved in two projects - one on smoking and one on gestational diabetes - that were both promised data and then refused at the last minute.  

How can we get the balance right of data access for trusted experts and data privacy for all?

One extreme option is to completely block access to health data for all researchers. Now I am not being devil's advocate here, I think this is a genuine option that should be considered.

The benefits of this approach is that it greatly reduces the risk of data breaches and misuse of data. It would also save enormous amounts of time for Australian researchers, who currently waste time applying for data that will never arrive. Researchers could instead access data from other countries, making better use of their time and providing more overall benefits for society. For example, the US government released national data on daily temperatures, pollution levels and deaths for 108 US cities over 14 years. These data were used by researchers across the world to increase our understanding of the harms of extreme heat and high pollution levels. They directly informed US policy on these issues. They were also used to develop new statistical methods.  

A "no data" system in Australia would mean that we do not learn about improvements to our health system. Instead we would need to adopt innovations based on findings from other countries. That is risky as our health system is idiosyncratic, even between states.

Another option is to use specially constructed data sets, like the Australian Longitudinal Study on Womenâ€™s Health or the 45 and up study. These collect detailed data from people who have consented and understand the risks. But these great examples do not cover every important research question. 

Another option is to create a trusted user status. And I have discussed this with colleagues at the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That's where users get more rights to data access after demonstrating their competence, either through courses or the successful completion of projects. I like this approach, but it would need to be properly funded and is quite a new approach, so some kinks would need to be ironed out. 

There's also the [OpenSAFELY](https://www.opensafely.org/) system in the UK that provides secure access and is highly transparent. Users in this system get access to random data that they can use to build their code, then they send their developed code in, and get the results sent back to them. So they can use very detailed individual data for very low risk.

So a technological solution is possible. 

Another approach is to be more liberal with data access and have huge penalties for those who misuse or lose data. This puts a lot more risk on the researcher, which I am comfortable with. Datasets can be watermarked by adding random digits to a small number of variables. So if a dataset was ever lost and then put on the dark web, the authorities could trace the researcher responsible. 

I appreciate that I probably sound like I'm moaning about data access from a very privileged position. I think it would be great to hear the public's expectations about what data they are willing to share and how. So a national forum to discuss the risks and benefits of data sharing for research, this would bring together bureaucrats, lawyers, statisticians and the public to openly discuss the options. There's unlikely to be one consistent view from the public, but we could at least set some boundaries on the expectations that would inform a better national policy.

But the current situation is that data access is controlled by a very small pool of individuals, and whose interests are best served by taking no risks and not sharing data. I think the recent breach of Medicare data means that data access is going to become even harder for researchers. Personally, I have given up trying to access health data because of repeated bad experiences. We really need to have a national discussion about these issues.
