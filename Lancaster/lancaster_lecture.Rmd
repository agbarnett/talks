# Pressure for "good" results

Survey of US statisticians; reported requests in last 5 years:

* Removing or altering data to better support the research hypothesis = 24%

* Not reporting the presence of key missing data that might bias the results = 24%

* Ignoring violations of assumptions that would change results from positive to negative = 29%

# What can we check?

*	Numerical errors in text and tables using existing tools, e.g.,: “10/20 (55%)”

*	P-values and confidence intervals. Checks for inconsistencies and errors using existing tools

*	Sample size calculations. Checks of whether the sample size can be reproduced

*	Linear and logistic regression models. Checks of whether appropriate model assumptions have been verified

*	Missing data. Checks to detect missing data in the results that have not been mentioned in the methods 

* Fraudulant data, groups in randomised trials that are too similar

---
# What more can we check?

* Outcome switching by comparing the protocol and published paper

* Qualitative guidance on interpreting p-values

* Poorly designed figures

* Citation manipulation
