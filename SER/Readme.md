Title: “What has it meant to be an epidemiologist in 2020: 2021 redux”

Abstract: Given the COVID-19 pandemic, pandemic response, social and cultural movements, and numerous other local and global events in 2020, many epidemiologists are probing the meaning of epidemiology as a discipline and practice, and what it means to be an epidemiologist. Epidemiologists’ work has been profoundly impacted, regardless of whether we work on infectious disease or in other subdisciplines; whether we work in academia, government, industry, or other settings; whether we took on additional caregiver responsibilities or experienced personal hardships; whether we took on new roles to serve our communities in addition to our usual work…the list goes on. Further, many epidemiologists are making profound impacts. Our collective experiences in 2020 will shape the future of our field. With this in mind, the editors of EPIDEMIOLOGY commissioned a series of commentaries with the theme of reflecting on this question: “What has it meant for me to be an epidemiologist in 2020?” Our goal was to obtain a wide range of voices regarding work setting, topic area, gender identity, race/ethnicity, career stage, and geography. 20 contributors wrote powerful essays, appearing in the January 2021 issue of the journal. Here we invited five of them to offer further reflections and updates, followed by ample time for audience reflections and discussion.
