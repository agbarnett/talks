## Deluge of poor quality papers

- March 2020 _Lancet_ paper<sup>1</sup> of in-hospital mortality which excluded `r round(100*613/813)`% of the sample because they were still in hospital

- _Surgisphere_ scandal

- Over 200 COVID prediction models<sup>2</sup>, almost all have been "useless" (Laure Wynants)

<!--- - Show failed grants. In all that modelling, I wouldn't have done anything so extreme.
Perhaps more of an appetite for worst-case scenarios. --->
