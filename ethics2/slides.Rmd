# Ethics is vital for research

# This is my perspective as a researcher, I have biases

# Four bad examples

---
## Bad example #1: [national vaccine study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1753-6405.12929)

```{r, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='figures/vaccine.png')
```

--

* Six years to finally get data

* Funding ended before data was received

* Western Australia withdrew

* "convoluted", "inconsistent"

* "Extensive negotiation [...] between 18 different agencies"


---
## Bad example #2: [discarded samples](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ans.15447)

```{r, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='figures/infection.png')
```

--

* 11+ months

* 106 emails

* valuable samples lost

* "over-bureaucratisation"

 
---
### Lots more to choose from

```{r, out.width='84%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='figures/lots_papers.png')
```

## Bad example #3: patient engagement

* Chat with heart failure patients about thermal clothing

* Documentation was a NEAF, protocol, cover letter, participant information and consent form, and CVs

* Approval process took 4 months

--

* Interviews lasted 2 hours

* Approvals not commensurate with the level of risk

## Bad example #4: drive-through

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/U3JOffKzRRP40Ua3cH/giphy.gif)

* Poorly ventilated spaces with vehicles idling

* Easily fixed with "air" windows

--

* Multiple companies declined to engage with me

* Applied to ethics to conceal purpose of a monitoring study from employers ... was rejected

.pull-left[

* "I was once told by the Chairperson of an ethics committee that he saw its role as making sure that the
university didn’t get sued" [Guillemin et&nbsp;al](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1525/jer.2012.7.3.38)

* HREC member: "To ensure that someone is not going off on a frolic that will destroy or damage the reputation of the university" (ibid)

<!--- * I prioritise learning something important about the world over the risk of upsetting some people --->

## Too much oversight in Australia

.pull-left[

* "For exempting low-risk health and medical research: "The broadest set of exemptions exist in the Netherlands and the narrowest in Australia." [Scott et&nbsp;al.](https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12961-019-0520-4#Tab1) 

<!--- * "Sometimes it can be quite adversarial" [Guillemin et&nbsp;al](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1525/jer.2012.7.3.38) --->

### Ethics creep?

```{r, out.width='55%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='figures/spanish_church.jpg')
```

* Typographical comments 

* "To tinker with the methodology at the edges I think is outside their remit" [Guillemin et&nbsp;al](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1525/jer.2012.7.3.38)

--

* 13/34 of the ethics committee members indicated that they were aware of the National Statement but did not often refer to it ... 3 ethics committee members had not read the National Statement [Guillemin et&nbsp;al](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1525/jer.2012.7.3.38)

* Audio version of the statement here [here](https://osf.io/yefv8/)

## Research rush

--

* The quality of the submission (ensuring correct attachments, up to date documents, clear information etc.) could account for a significant proportion of the burden and delay associated with ethical review [Brandenburg et al](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1747016121999935)

---
## Hidden costs

```{r, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='figures/anna_paper.png')
```

* Survey of Australian health/medical researchers and Human Research Ethics Committee members

--

* 43% of researchers reported changing projects in anticipation of obstacles from the ethics review process

* 25% of researchers reported abandoning projects 

* Research methods were altered so that a project could be classified as a low/negligible risk rather than higher risk, to avoid a full ethics review

---

## Quotes

* "Avoiding obtaining data from certain groups for example, those under 18 years old, pregnant women, Indigenous peoples, and those with disability"

--

* "Reducing the number of HRECs involved, especially avoiding those known to have few sittings a year and very long lead times"

--

* "I am an Aboriginal researcher undertaking Aboriginal community health research in my own community. The HREC regarded my situation as a conflict of interest, so I changed my ethics application status from CI-A to CI-D so I could continue to engage with my own community."

--

* "Many projects I have been involved with have been abandoned because the ethics approval process takes too long and is too laborious, especially for junior researchers"

--

* "Current processes for low risk are so cumbersome at my local health service: 100-page submission that still needs to be signed off by CEO of hospital even for low risk with site governance from another committee!"

## Publication misconception

.pull-left[

"The criteria that pushes this over a threshold for ethics review is the desire to publish and disseminate the research further."

<!--- Many ethics committee members expressed the opinion that if the research was to be published in a journal then it required ethical approval, even if it was negligible or low risk.--->

<!--- Most medical journals allow authors to explain why their research is exempt, and regularly publish research that did not require or receive ethical review. --->

## So here's what we did

```{r, out.width='44%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='figures/petition.png')
```

* Not just a few cranky researchers

---
background-image: url(figures/quote.png)
## Petition gave us more great quotes

* "Our department usually has about 16 active trials at a time & now has now a dedicated nurse just to manage ethics and governance requirements. This is at a cost of $130,000/year"

--

* "I’ve lost funding previously because governance requirements could not be met within funding timelines"

--

* "As a busy clinical researcher I spend hundreds of unpaid hours doing these forms!"

--

* "Regulatory hurdles are harming patients by delaying vital research"

--

* "No country bureaucratized its way to excellence"

---
## Political meetings

* Met Science Minister's staff member (Karen Andrews)

* October 2019 submitted executive brief to Health Minister including petition, economic costs, survey quotes (Greg Hunt)

--

* Discussed with Labor MP Andrew Leigh

* Zoom meeting with Labor staff member

--

* No response from The Greens

* Met with Medicines Australia

* Had session at AIMOS conference and frequently talked with other researchers

## Questions

.pull-left[

* "I think researchers hate ethics committees, I have rarely found a researcher and I mean good researchers, mediocre and bad, in my realm of work every year, who don’t bitch about ethics committees" [Guillemin et&nbsp;al](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1525/jer.2012.7.3.38)
