*Title*: “Why is this taking so long?” The views of health and medical researchers on delays in ethics and governance

*Authors*: Adrian Barnett (QUT), Anna Scott (Bond), Natalie Taylor (Sydney), Jennifer Byrne (Sydney)

*Abstract*: Many Australian researchers have had frustrating experiences with getting the necessary ethics and governance approvals to start a study, often spending much more time and funding on these processes than they budgeted for. Low- and negligible-risk research – which is often exempted from review in other countries – can often take many months to get approved in Australia, with far longer times for multi-site or multi-state projects. Researchers can create delays by submitting incomplete applications, but delays are also caused by the approval process including unnecessary duplication, requests for unimportant changes, and long waits for reviews and signatures. We surveyed Australian researchers and found that 43% of those to whom the question applied reported changing projects in anticipation of obstacles from the ethics review process, and 25% had abandoned projects for this reason. Surveys of researchers have reported that ethics and governance processes had become adversarial, which is far from the ideal system. What can be done to improve the system for both researchers and ethics/governance staff? Would a self-certification scheme for low/negligible risk research – as used in the USA – be acceptable and feasible in Australia?
