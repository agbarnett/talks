* Quickly uncover new insights
* Hear from key groups
* Compare trends over time with repeat surveys
* Compare changes after a policy/practice change

## Mistake #1 → Too long{background-color='#d4cebe'}

:::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
* Ideally 5 mins, no more than 15 mins
* Can be longer if you're paying people
* My shortest survey was three questions (DOI: [10.1371/journal.pone.0214047](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214047))

## Mistake #2 → Leading questions{background-color='white'}

* How tired did you feel after the new exercise regime?

* How much better did you feel after the new exercise regime?

Use neutral wording -- get colleagues and friends to check
  
## Mistake #2 → Leading questions{background-color='white' visibility="uncounted"}

* How tired did you feel after the new exercise regime?

Use neutral wording -- get colleagues and friends to check

## Mistake #2 → Leading questions

## Mistake #3 → No pilot study{background-image='figures/nguyen-dang-hoang-nhu-qDgTQOYk6B8-unsplash.jpg' background-opacity=0.25 background-size='cover'}

* Find typos and questions that are hard to read or vague

* Find missing skip logic

## Mistake #4 → Repeat questions

* How are you feeling today on a scale of 1 (worst ever) to 10 (best ever)

_Later in the questionnaire_

* Tell us about your mood today, from 10 (best ever) to 1 (worst ever) 

## Mistake #4 → Repeat questions{visibility="uncounted"}

* How are you feeling today on a scale of 1 (worst ever) to 10 (best ever)

Some exceptions:

 * Discrete choice experiments

* For example, every Human Research Ethics Committee in Australia

* Not a sample

* Confidence intervals do not make sense (no wider population)

## Imposter participants{background-image='figures/stefano-pollio-ZC0EbdLC8G0-unsplash.jpg' background-opacity=0.25 background-size='cover'}

* "Potential participants were recruited via a publicly available social media advert on Facebook offering $50 AUD compensation."

* "We identified imposters at an early stage via inconsistencies in their self-reported geographical location and that captured by the survey as well as recognition of suspicious actions before, during and after focus group discussions and interviews."

* Can also exclude people based on IP address

* Report all exclusions

## Randomise{background-image='figures/riho-kroll-m4sGYaHYN5o-unsplash.jpg' background-opacity=0.2 background-size='cover'}

* Randomising reduces bias

* Randomise the order of questions (e.g., demographics first or last), can find question order effects

Respondents can give great quotes:

* “No country bureaucratised its way to excellence” - comment on our survey on ethics

* “not needed for 99.9% of applications” - comment on whether ethics committees need statisticians
