# TRI Directorâ€™s Choice Seminar 2022

*Title*: Bad statistics in medical research

*Abstract*: Using the wrong statistical methods can completely invalidate a study's results, potentially wasting years of hard work and misdirecting future research and policy. Despite the importance of statistics, many medical researchers do not have adequate training and/or access to a qualified statistician. Researchers often attempt complex study designs that require advanced statistical knowledge. A common example is diagnostic accuracy studies, but a review of over 200 COVID-19 prediction models found only one of any value with many using statistical methods that were inappropriate and/or badly described. I will make the case for researchers to use simple study designs that only require basic statistical methods. I will discuss the potential for automated statistical reviews to improve research quality.
