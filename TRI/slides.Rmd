<!--- * Incorrectly used logistic regression instead of survival analysis --->

* 813 hospitalised, 613 (75%) excluded because they were still hospitalised or not confirmed as infected

### Two implications:

* Bad research is not restricted to "low impact" journals

* Has been cited 25,000+ times: Many researchers do not recognise the serious statistical flaw

# Quiz question
<!--- Add a menti with options --->

#### https://www.menti.com/5624oqzron

#### Go to www.menti.com and use the code 3205 7080

The P value is the probability ...

* that the null hypothesis is true

* that the alternative hypothesis is true

* that the study worked

* that the results happened by chance

* of obtaining the observed or more extreme results if the alternative hypothesis is true

In the past three years how often have you: 

* Not attempted to publish a valid "negative" or "neutral" study = 25%
* Selected the statistical method that provided the desired result = 8% ...
* ... Rises to 30% when asking about witnessing this approach in others
