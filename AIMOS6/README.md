# AIMOS conference in Sydney, November 2025

60 minute discussion group.

Title: AIMOS and MetaROR: Moving forward after our metascience platform's first year.

Authors: Adrian Barnett, Jennifer Byrne, Jason Chin, Alex Holcombe

Abstract: [MetaROR](https://metaror.org/) is a new platform for meta-research that coordinates peer review for preprints in meta-research using the publish-review-curate model. It is supported by AIMOS and RoRI and was launched the 2024 AIMOS conference. The Australian members of the MetaROR editorial team will give an update on the first year, which has seen a healthy number of articles and eight partnerships with journals including _PLOS Biology_. We will also discuss plans for improvement and financial sustainability.

We are keen to hear the views of meta-researchers. Have you submitted to MetaROR? Do you have any concerns about MetaROR? What should we keep and what should we change? Are there experiments we could run? How could MetaROR further support early-career researchers and scholars, and promote diversity and inclusion within our community? We aim to have a lively and open discussion about current activities and the future of MetaROR.
