Title: Partial Randomisation at The British Academy. Presented with Ken Emond, British Academy.

Abstract: The British Academy began trialling a conditional lottery to award funding for its Small Research Grants in 2023. These grants are for Â£10,000 and up to two years and open to all UK scholars working in the humanities and social sciences. In a conditional lottery all applicants are peer reviewed, but the reviewers only assess whether the application is of sufficient quality (yes or no) rather than giving applications a score. All applications meeting the quality threshold are then awarded funding at random. Since the change, over 2,000 applications have met the quality threshold and been randomised to receive funding. The change-over has seen around an extra 500 applications per round, and an increase in non-white applicants. There's also been a greater geographic spread across the UK. More detailed outcomes are being monitored in an ongoing trial. We have recently applied the conditional lottery into a second scheme for seed funding for early career researchers.
