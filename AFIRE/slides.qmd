* Fellowship was NZD $150,000 (Â£70,000) over 3 years

## Survey of applicants{background-color='#f9f9f9'}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

<small>

* Randomisation is an acceptable method, with 63% in favour and 25% against

::: incremental
* Researchers wanted ineligible applications to be excluded and outstanding applications funded, so the remaining applications were truly equal

* Greater support for randomisation amongst those that won funding at random

## <small>Priority setting on research funding</small>{background-color='#dcdfd8'}

:::: columns
::: {.column width="67%"}

#### <small>Top 2 questions:</small>

* Would a lottery be fairer and more efficient without reducing quality?

* How much is enough effort for applying + judging application efforts, before a random lottery-style allocation becomes just as good as further adjudication?

<small>

* Reduces cronyism (and perception of cronyism)

::: incremental
* Increases diversity in applicants and winners

* Reduces application and review costs

* Acknowledges that science is unpredictable

* Reduces stigma of failure

* Might reduce "Matthew effect"

* Applicants might try more innovative ideas

* Creates an ideal randomised trial of funding

## Summary{background-image='figures/florian-schmetz-fbCtFV3FkfE-unsplash.jpg' background-size='cover' background-opacity=0.4}

::: incremental
* Complex application systems may feel thorough, but they are costly and potentially amplify biases

* There will never be a perfect system for the incredibly difficult task of accurately allocating research funding

* Lotteries can be the most scientific approach
