<!--- * Incorrectly used logistic regression instead of survival analysis --->

* 813 hospitalised, 613 (75%) excluded because they were still hospitalised or not confirmed as infected

--

### Two implications:

* Bad research is not restricted to "low impact" journals

* Has been cited 25,000+ times: Many researchers do not recognise the serious statistical flaw

<!--- Stop developing prediction models (hard), talk about standard text in justification, talk about stochastic variability, rule out tests might still be useful, e.g. Troponin. Appreciate that data changes. Most predictive value comes from a few variables.--->
