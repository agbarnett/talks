* Some advisors only discovered they were an advisor after our approach

* Most advisors were positive about their ability to help colleagues deal with integrity issues

* Multiple institutions where we found it difficult to find anything about research integrity and other institutions where the contact about research integrity was a generic e-mail or generic online form.
