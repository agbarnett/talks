* [2021 study of funding applications](https://tinyurl.com/3efkad6y) in Canada found smaller bias against women in project-based applications than people-based applications.

* [2021 study of fellowships](https://tinyurl.com/ymanp4p9) in Brazil with randomly allocated gender. Male applicants received higher scores for all categories evaluated.

## Modified lottery

## Stage 1: Peer review used to rule out ineligible or terrible applications

## Stage 2: Winners then awarded at random until funds are exhausted

## Researchers' view 

<!--- could add image --->

* Survey of New Zealand researchers who had experienced randomisation

* Randomisation is an acceptable method for allocating Explorer Grant funds with 63% (n = 79) in favour and 25% (n = 32) against

--

* Randomisation supported after ineligible applications had been excluded and outstanding applications funded, so that the remaining applications were truly equal

* Greater support for randomisation amongst those that won funding at random

## Political problems

.pull-left[

"It would make it look like we don’t know what we’re doing." Research Officer.

"Some critics have been suggesting that peer review is just too much hard work and perhaps a lottery would be better. Mind you this is a suggestion from economists, so take that any way you want." Warwick Anderson, ex-NHMRC CEO, 2015
