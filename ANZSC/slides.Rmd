* [2021 study of funding applications](https://tinyurl.com/3efkad6y) in Canada found smaller bias against women in project-based applications than people-based applications.

* [2021 study of fellowships](https://tinyurl.com/ymanp4p9) in Brazil with randomly allocated gender. Male applicants received higher scores for all categories evaluated.

## Researchers' view 

<!--- could add image --->

* Survey of New Zealand researchers who had experienced randomisation

* Randomisation is an acceptable method for allocating Explorer Grant funds with 63% (n = 79) in favour and 25% (n = 32) against

--

* Supported after ineligible applications had been excluded and outstanding applications funded, so that the remaining applications were truly equal

* Greater support for randomisation amongst those that won funding at random

"It would make it look like we don’t know what we’re doing." Research Officer.

"Some critics have been suggesting that peer review is just too much hard work and perhaps a lottery would be better. Mind you this is a suggestion from economists, so take that any way you want." Warwick Anderson, 2015
