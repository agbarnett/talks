*Title*: Using lotteries to award funding in health and medical research

*Abstract*: Almost all health and medical research funding is awarded using peer review. These processes are usually highly competitive, costly and opaque. The number of peer reviewers is often small, typically five or fewer, meaning the scores for many applications cannot be statistically separated. We bootstrapped peer reviewer scores for NHMRC Project Grants and found that the funding decision for 29% of applications depended on the selection of panel members, meaning these key decisions are somewhat random. We have investigated whether peer review could be replaced with a modified lottery that screens out poor applications and then awards funding at random. The potential advantages are a reduction in bias (including sexism and racism), lower costs, and possibly even faster scientific breakthroughs because more truly innovative work is funded. We will present the results of a survey of 126 New Zealand researchers who were awarded funding using a modified lottery. We will highlight some experiments that could be achieved if funders codified some element of randomness in their funding decisions. We will mention the political problems with using lotteries and our ongoing engagement with funders.
