Title: How fraud is undermining scientific research

Abstract: The competitive “publish or perish” research world is driving some researchers to use underhand means to get ahead of the game. Derivative papers written by large language models are flooding parts of the literature. These papers have no intention of contributing to science and only exist to promote the authors’ careers. Unscrupulous authors can pay for authorship on papers generated by paper mills, who have successfully published their shoddy work in “high impact” journals. Publishers are often slow to retract these papers, even when there is cast-iron evidence of plagiarism and fakery. Some publishers even seem happy to take the article processing charges with no concern for their own reputation or the wider impacts on science. Many fraudulent papers have been unwittingly used in national guidelines, causing harms for potentially thousands of patients.

Scientific fraud is worsening and the research community must react. We must stop playing the prestige game by ignoring gameable metrics and instead using reward systems that focus on content rather than quantity. We must embrace open science and create paper trails of our progress to differentiate genuine research from instantly created fakery. Publishers with hundreds of fraudulent papers who refuse to retract them must be deindexed.
