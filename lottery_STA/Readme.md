*Title*: Awarding Small Grants at Random: A novel way to increase fairness & reduce costs.

*Abstract*: Societies often award small grants to support research, for example, top-ups for PhD students or funding for pilot studies. The often-competitive process is ultimately decided by the reviewers. But what happens when there are many worthy applicants? 

When reviewers face difficult decisions, they may fall-back on simple information, such as the applicants’ number of papers and grants. This disadvantages those who have had career disruption and can lead to a snowball effect, where past success creates more success. Some funding schemes use lengthy applications to help differentiate applicants, but the combined time-costs can then be greater than the funding awarded. Furthermore, there’s no strong evidence that an intensive application process leads to better outcomes, which is likely because of the inherent unpredictably of science. 

Professor Adrian Barnett will present a novel alternative for increasing fairness and reducing costs: awarding funding at random. In this approach, applications are examined by peer reviewers, but only to decide if they are fundable or not. Awards are then made at random from the fundable group. This can increase (and guarantee) the diversity of successful applicants, reduce the length of the process, and the chances of unwarranted biases creeping into the decision-making process. It also increases the perception of fairness, for example, accusations of favouritism are avoided if the president’s PhD student wins a prize.

The Statistical Society of Australia has successfully used partial randomisation to award small grants. This process has also been implemented by the New Zealand Health Research Council and is being trialled by other funders in Europe.
