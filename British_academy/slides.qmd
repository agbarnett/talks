## <small>Priority setting on research funding</small>{background-color='#dcdfd8'}

:::: columns
::: {.column width="63%"}

#### Top 2 questions:

* Would a lottery be fairer and more efficient without reducing quality?

* How much is enough effort for applying + judging application efforts, before a random lottery-style allocation becomes just as good as further adjudication?
