## New Zealand Health Research Council Trial

* Fellowship funding was NZD $150,000 over 3 years.

 
 
## Participant consent in HRC

* All applicants were asked if they were willing for our research team to follow their career **if they did not win funding**. 

* Data from applicants **who won funding** were publicly available and hence included. Applicants were informed of this.

## Disappointing consent results

::: incremental
* Only 66% consented (81 out of 123)

Fear: "You asked for too much" - only wanted their grant number. 

"Of the 51 offices approached, 30 (59%) agreed to distribute an email invitation to their researchers. " https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/5/e002800

* Researchers who consented had 52% more publications than those who did not consent (95% credible interval 5 to 121). 
* Mean years of experience was 17 for those who consented and 14 for those who did not.

* Reduces statistical power and generalisability

## Quality improvement in Canada

* Title: What Factors are Important to the Success of Resubmitted Grant Applications in Health Research? A Retrospective Study of Over 20,000 Applications to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research

* "Our study included an objective of quality assurance and quality improvement of CIHR’s programs and thus fell under Article 2.5 of Tri-Council Policy Statement."

* Section 2.5: "Quality assurance and quality improvement studies, program evaluation activities, and performance reviews, or testing within normal educational requirements when used exclusively for assessment, management or improvement purposes, do not constitute research for the purposes of this Policy, and do not fall within the scope of REB review."

## Quality improvement in Australia

* "consider [...] whether the people involved [...] will be exposed to
any risk, burden, inconvenience or possible breach of their privacy"

* participants in QA/evaluation are afforded appropriate protections and respect

*	QA and/or evaluation is undertaken to generate outcomes that are used to assess and/or improve service provision

*	 those who undertake QA and/or evaluation adhere to relevant ethical principles and state, territory and Commonwealth legislation

## BMJ policy on meta-research

"We are constantly trying to find ways of improving our peer review system and continually monitor processes and methods by including article submissions and reviewers’ reports in our research. If you do not want your paper or review entered into our peer review research programme, please let us know by emailing papersadmin@bmj.com."

"Legitimate interests
Your personal data will also be processed because it is necessary for BMJ Group's
legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party. This will always be
weighed against your rights, interests and expectations. Examples of where we
process data for purposes that fall under legitimate interests include:
[...]
● contacting authors and reviewers (and instructing researchers to do the same)
for development, monitoring and quality improvement of our processes;"

* "The BMJ is committed to improving the evidence base around the publishing process"

* "Some publishers are concerned about data protection and privacy issues, others are just secretive"

* Authors must opt out of their papers being included in research

## Examples of research that did not need ethical clearance

Papers from 2024 published in the _BMJ_.

* _Association of holidays and the day of the week with suicide risk_. Used daily data from 26 countries. 
"Ethical clearance not required"

* _Use of progestogens and the risk of intracranial meningioma: national case-control study_. France. 
"As an authorised permanent user of the SNDS, the author’s team was exempt from approval from the institutional review board."

* _Prenatal opioid exposure and subsequent risk of neuropsychiatric disorders in children: nationwide birth cohort study in South Korea
_. "We conducted this study using de-identified administrative data that were obtained without prior consent."
