## Absurb

``To assume that a rank could possibly say anything meaningful about the quality of a university relative to other universities, be it as a workplace or as a place to study, is downright absurd.''

<p style="font-size:70%">"Chinese and Indian universities are taking more of the top spots in the rankings than before, with UK, US and Australian institutions in decline. If those currently at the top wait too long to speak out, they might soon find themselves lower down the ranks, with less clout to drive the reforms that would serve all institutions."

## Other stuff {visibility="uncounted"}

* INORMS - qualitative CV

* Counting Nobel-prize winning alumni

* Science is not a competition

* None of these flagship rankings adequately consider open access, equality, diversity, sustainability or other society-focused agendas

* Deeply flawed reputational surveys

* ‘Which is the best university in the world?’ is not a useful question. ‘Which university might be best for me, given that I care about X and Y?’
