## More "research on research"


### "We believe that much more research needs to be done on the nature of research and its application so that data from objective studies can be applied to all aspects of biomedical research. Because the very nature of research on research, particularly if it is prospective, requires long periods of time, we recommend that independent, highly competent groups be established with ample, long term support to conduct and support retrospective and prospective research on the nature of scientific discovery, to analyse the causes of long and short lags between discovery and clinical application and to suggest and test means of decreasing long lags, and to evaluate present and proposed mechanisms for the support of biomedical research and development.''
