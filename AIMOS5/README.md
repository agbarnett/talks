Title: Who opts for open peer review?

Abstract: Since 2019, the publisher PLOS has given authors the option of publishing the peer review history if their article is accepted. This includes the decision letters, editorial feedback and peer reviewers’ comments, and the authors’ responses. We examined the characteristics of articles that opted for open peer review, including the countries and article types most likely to opt in to peer review. We used an elastic net to estimate the predictors. We included over 112,000 articles, with 40% opting in to open peer review. Nepal and Ethiopia had the biggest increases in the probability of opting for open peer review (around 0.10 higher than average), whilst Serbia and Tunisia had the biggest decreases (around 0.08 lower). “Methods and Resources” articles had a 0.15 higher probability than average of opting for open peer review. Articles with open peer review were far less likely to be retracted, with a hazard ratio for the time from publication to retraction of 0.44 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.56; Cox survival model). Most authors do not opt for open peer review and there are large differences in who does. Opting for open peer review could be a marker of article quality by signalling author teams who welcome transparency in all aspects of their research.
