## Declarations

* ### Current member of the NHMRC Research Committee

* ### Past and current research on research funding

* ### Previous winner of NHMRC Senior Research Fellowship

--

* ### Seven failures prior to that success and three failures since

---
## Failure is the norm

```{r, out.width='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='figures/when_to_quit.jpg')
```

Twelve failures needed to give a 90% probability that you are in the bottom half of the talent pool

## Consider creating a group

```{r, out.width='85%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='figures/group.jpg')
```

---
## Online presence

* Make sure your CV is easily available

* Staff page up to date

* Check Google Scholar, ORCID, etc

* Think about social media, e.g., X and LinkedIn

* Consider timing a Conversation article to coincide with peer review time

---
## The application

* ### Convince the reader that this is a big problem

* ### Grab their attention early

* ### Start with simplest points and build in complexity

* ### Think about a general reader, not a specialist

* ### Ask colleagues to read your application and be brutal

* ### Cut anything you feel uncertain about

---
## Miscellaneous tips for the proposal

* Use white space, don't cram it in. Can use figures and bullets to break up dense text.

* Don't squeeze in too much. Focus on the most interesting complete "story" rather than listing everything you want to do. 

* Use acronyms and jargon very sparingly

* Can use colour

* Avoid over-promising and hyperbole

--

* Let reader know early about your expertise

* "References [Bold text is my own work]"

* Include at least one reference from 2023 (same advice for top ten)

--

* It's fine to reference pre-prints

* Could think about adding technical details in a box

* Reach out to important groups and get their input and mention this in the proposal


---
## Miscellaneous tips for leadership and impact

* Extraordinary claims need to be backed up

* If you reference some evidence from a very long paper or report then add the page number where the evidence can be found (e.g., ``My work was discussed in the 2022 WHO report on climate change mitigation (see pages 202-203)'')

* Can add personal quotes, e.g., someone praising your mentoring

* Make sure your top ten papers are easily available, not behind pay-walls (use Incognito window or computer at home to see if access is easy)

* I added citation and Altmetic numbers for all my top ten
---
## Reviewer's perspective

* I reviewed 22 

* Very difficult to score applicants

* Top ten papers: Read all abstracts, read two per applicant - the ones that interested me the most

* Other reviewers can be obsessed by author order. May need to say things like: "I mentored my postdoc to be senior author"

* My harshest feedback was for those I thought would get funded, because I wanted them to consider my points before they ran their studies
