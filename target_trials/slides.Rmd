# Useful where you cannot randomise

#### The trial that we would have liked to conduct.

* #### Antibiotics or antidepressants during pregnancy

* #### ECMO treatment for hospitalised patients during the pandemic

* #### (Examples from audience)

--

* #### Cannot regain a blinded trial - more suited to pragmatic trials

* #### Cannot examine placebos - these are not given in practice (?)

# Start with a question

.pull-left[

* ### Do statins reduce the risk of colorectal cancer? [PMC7746409](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7746409/)

* ### Then write a trial protocol

# Inclusion criteria #1

### Do statins reduce the risk of colorectal cancer?

* ### Age 30 or over
* ### No history of cancer
* ### No statin contraindication
* ### No statin prescription within the past year
* ### LDL cholesterol under 5 mmol/L

---
# Inclusion criteria #2

* ### May have to make modifications as observational data will never be as bespoke as trial data. 

* ### For example:

```{r}
table = read.table(header=TRUE, sep='&', text='
Data&A&T
No history of cancer&Ask patient at baseline visit&No diagnoses in electronic health records
Blood tests&Taken at baseline visit&From nearest available test in electronic health records') %>%
  rename('Actual trial' = 'A',
         'Target trial' = 'T')
ftab = flextable(table) %>%
  theme_box() %>%
  fontsize(size = 18, part = 'all') %>%
  width(j=1, width=2.8) %>%
  width(j=2, width=3) %>%
  width(j=3, width=3.5) 
ftab
```

# Exchangeable assumption

.pull-left[

* ### All about randomness

* ### Actual trial: patients could have been in either group (exchangeable)

* ### Target trial: patients are exchangeable at baseline given their covariates

# Flow chart

## Time is the enemy 

.pull-left[

* ### Deaths due to other causes (competing risks)

* ### Moved away

# Intention-to-treat

.pull-left[

* ### How the trial intended to treat people at randomisation

* ### Gives a realistic picture of the treatment in practice

* ### Researchers get this wrong more often than not

# Per protocol

* ### Gives a more optimistic picture of the treatment

* ### If everyone took the treatment and 'behaved'

* ### Censor individuals if and when they deviate from their assigned treatment strategy

* ### For example, patient 'randomised' to no treatment develops high cholesterol and is given treatment (censor at that point)

* ### Use inverse-probability weights to adjust for pre- and post-baseline prognostic factors associated with treatment adherence and loss to follow-up

---
## Confounders

```{r, out.width='55%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='figures/DAG2.png')
```

### If the "treatment" is ozone then:

* ### heat is a confounder (heat occurs first)

* ### baby gender is not a confounder

# Results 

### Do statins reduce the risk of colorectal cancer?

```{r}
tab = read.table(header = TRUE, sep='&', text = '
Study&OR&X
Target trial (Intention to treat)&1.00&0.87 to 1.16
Target trial (Per protocol)&0.90&0.71 to 1.12
Case control study&0.53&0.38 to 0.74') %>%

  width(j=3, width=2.7) %>%
  align(j=2:3, align='center', part='all') %>%
  fontsize(size = 19, part='all')
ftab
```
* ### The case-control study showed a strong (implausible) benefit to statins

# Recommendations


.pull-left[
* ### If you can do a parallel randomised trial then do

* ### ALWAYS write a protocol

* ### ALWAYS work carefully and slowly

* ### Getting high-quality health observational data in Australia is often very challenging
