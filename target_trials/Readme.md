# Disussion at QUT on target trials

*Title*: Target trials, a brief introduction

*Abstract*: Target trials attempt to replicate a randomised trial using observational data. They will never be as good as actual randomised trials, but they can be better than a standard analysis using observational data. They are a good alternative when a trial is not possible and there is a large and detailed observational data set available to "recruit" patients from. I will show an example of a target trial that estimated if taking statins reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. I will discuss the important considerations of: confounding, loss to follow-up, intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis.
