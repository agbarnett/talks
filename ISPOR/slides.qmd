## Conflicts of interest

-   Current member and past president of the Statistical Society of
    Australia
-   Current president of Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-research
    & Open Science (AIMOS)

## I like working with economists

<!--   Economics is still not perfect, obsession with p-values. But still at least focused on the practical implications of decisions.-->

## Common ground for statistics and economics

::: incremental
-   Relatively small field with highly specialised skills on a numerate
    topic
-   We receive lots of "amazing" opportunities to be involved in
    research projects, sometimes at the last minute
-   We are often the first thing cut from the budget
-   Seen by some as a service role rather than a fellow scientist
-   Struggle to get funding (everyone struggles)
:::

## What is statistics?

-   Statistics uses data to inform decision making
-   Data literacy is a key skill for most researchers

::: incremental
-   Bland and Altman: "Bad statistics makes bad research, bad research
    may lead to bad medicine, and bad medicine may cost lives."
-   David Spiegelhalter: "Why do people find probability so unintuitive
    and difficult? ...
-   ... Well after years of careful research I have finally concluded
    that it's because probability actually is unintuitive and
    difficult."

## Statistical methods section

-   17% used 50 words or fewer
-   12,675 papers (11%) closely matched to the sentence “a p-value \<
    0.05 was considered statistically significant”
-   Some sections just said "t-test" or "SPSS"

## Linear regression

-   Randomly selected 100 papers from *PLOS ONE* that used linear regression

::: incremental
-   Only 37% reported checking any linear regression assumptions

-   No authors checked all assumptions

-   Common misconception that the *Y* variable should be checked for
    normality, with only 5 of the 28 papers correctly checking the
    residuals

## Outranked

::: incremental
-   Me: "Hello Anon, I've just read the draft paper and there are an
    enormous amount of p-values. I'm sure you remember the
    long conversation we had about why this isn't a useful approach. Can
    we take them out, especially those don't relate to the main
    question? And for the main question can we use a mean difference
    with a confidence interval? I sent you those results."

-   Anon: "Adrian, thanks again for your help with the analysis. We do
    understand you point on the p-values. However, the journals and
    reviewers will expect to see them, hence we need to keep them in for
    this paper."

-   *Lancet* paper of in-hospital mortality which excluded 75% of the
    sample because they were still in hospital (DOI:

    Has over 33,000 citations

-   Over 600 COVID prediction models, almost all have been "useless"
    ([Living systematic
    review](https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj.o2009))

    years (DOI:
