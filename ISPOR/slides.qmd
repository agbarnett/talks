## Outline

TO DO, add AusHSI logo, smaller aside

-   Common ground between statistics and economics
-   Multiple examples of bad statistics
-   Consequences of missing expertise
-   What can we do

## Conflicts of interest

-   I am a statistician
-   Current member and past president of the Statistical Society of Australia
-   Current president of Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-research & Open Science (AIMOS)

## I like working with economists

<!--   Economics is still not perfect, obsession with p-values. But still at least focused on the practical implications of decisions.-->

## Common ground for statistics and economics

::: incremental
-   Relatively small field with highly specialised skills on a numerate topic
-   We receive lots of "amazing" opportunities to be involved in research projects, sometimes at the last minute
-   We are often the first thing cut from the budget
-   Seen by som as a service role rather than a fellow scientist
-   Struggle to get funding (everyone struggles)
:::

## What is statistics?

-   Statistics uses data to inform decision making
-   Data literacy is a key skill for most researchers

::: incremental
-   Bland and Altman: "Bad statistics makes bad research, bad research may lead to bad medicine, and bad medicine may cost lives."
-   David Spiegelhalter: "Why do people find probability so unintuitive and difficult? ...
- ... Well after years of careful research I have finally concluded that it's because probability actually is unintuitive and difficult."

## Linear regression

- Randomly selected papers from *PLOS ONE* that used linear regression 

- 37% reported checking any linear regression assumptions
- No authors checked all assumptions
- Common misconception that the *Y* variable should be checked for normality, with only 5 of the 28 papers correctly checking the residuals

-   Me: "Hello Anon, I've just read the draft paper and there are an enormous amount of p-values in the paper. I'm sure you remember the long conversation we had about why this isn't a useful approach. Can we take them out, especially those don't relate to the main question? And for the main question can we use a mean difference with a confidence interval? I sent you those results."

-   Anon: "Adrian, thanks again for your help with the analysis. We do understand you point on the p-values. However, the journals and reviewers will expect to see them, hence we need to keep them in for this paper."

## Shortage of statistical reviewers

- 23% used it for all articles

## More paper trails

- Openly share ethical clearances (DOI: [10.1177/1073110518766028](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-medicine-and-ethics/article/opening-closed-doors-promoting-irb-transparency/6A766FB4F7742F4FDADDACA83AF69176))

- More requirements for data and code sharing

- Researchers ran away when asked for data https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13041-020-0552-2
