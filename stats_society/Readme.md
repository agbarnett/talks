# Statistical Society of Australia Queensland Branch meeting (September 2021)

Slides are available [here](https://agbarnett.github.io/talks/stats_society/statisticians).

*Abstract*: Statisticians play a key role in almost all scientific research, and so are also key to tackling the reproducibility crisis which is undermining the value of much scientific research. Our role may be particularly important given that many problems with irreproducible papers are due to problems in the study design, statistical analysis and interpretation of results. We must promote more efficient, replicable and credible science, starting today, by being the role-model statisticians that we need for tomorrow.

Our four speakers will give their perspective on statistics and the reproducibility crisis, and also give their opinions on how statisticians can help improve the quality of research.
