# Statistical thinking course for the Critical Care Research Group, Queensland Health, February and March 2026

Title: Statistical thinking

A one-day course in statistics that focuses on statistical thinking and not statistical techniques. We will cover the "why" of good statistical practice rather than the "how". The course focuses on simple study designs and covers some common mistakes, with a range of practical exercises throughout the day. Topics include sample size, p-values, confidence intervals, the normal assumption, some common biases, creating good plots and causal models.
