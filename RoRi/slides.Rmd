# Uncertainty

# The problem: noise in funding decisions

### Study of American Institute of Biological Sciences:

### - 23% of total variance in reviewers' scores was due to applications

### - 77% was due to the reviewers and noise

##### Gallo et al, The Influence of Peer Reviewer Expertise on the Evaluation of Research Funding Applications [PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165147) 2016

# Single additional question for reviewers

#### We want to know how certain you were about your score and if you considered other scores. Can you estimate your probability of selecting each score? 

#### Please provide your answers as percentages.
```{r}
library(knitr)
table = read.table(header = TRUE, sep=',', text='
Score,Percent
7,
6,
5,
4,
3,
2,

Total,100%')
kable(table)
```

# Potential insights

### Does uncertainty vary by:

###* Reviewers' characteristics, e.g., gender and seniority
###* Review criteria, e.g., track record vs innovation
###* Application, e.g., readability score, word count

--

### Ultimate aim to target and reduce uncertainty

### Need around 400 responses

# Video and audio

# Process

### Recorded Powerpoint presentations instead of main text

### Videos can incorporate animations/videos, e.g., showing a new lab technique

--

### Could reduce application time? Could reduce review time?

### Could increase reviewer understanding?

--

### Could increase biases by gender or race?

### Could preference those with slick presentation skills?

# Video study

## Re-assess previously applications that were close to the funding line

## Randomly assign 50 reviewers per group to:

###- Text only

###- Video only

###- Text & Video

--

## Look for a reduction in the "grey zone" where the decision to fund is mixed

## Also collect data on time and reviewer satisfaction

class:inverse
# Audio pilot study

## Provide audio versions of written grants to reviewers

## Done using an automated voice so all applications sound the same; also cheap and easy

## Did reviewers use them? Did they find them useful? 

## Were more reviews completed? And more on time?

# Career disruption

#### Those with career disruption often have to share personal details to account for the gap in their CV

#### 12% of researchers in a recent survey said they don't share their career disruption, with a common reason being because they believe it will harm their chances of being funded

#### Bigger issue for women

#### Need to make it easier for researchers to claim career disruption

--

#### Pilot a separate medical/social panel to assess career disruption
