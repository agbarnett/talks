## "Significant" findings and the p-value

### "Significance'' has a special meaning in health and medicine; most often means statistical significance

### "Significance'' is judged by the p-value

### Arbitrary p-value threshold of 0.05 to sift results into significant or not, which is often misrepresented as important or not

--

### RECOVERY trial results for Dexamethasone were highly significant P $<$ 0.001, strongly suggesting a real benefit from Dexamethasone 

### ORBITA trial results for stents were not significant P = 0.2, which could mean that stents have no value in that patient-group

# Summary

* ### Science is the best thing that has happened to humanity

* ### We can do it better

* ### Carefully assess what evidence you read, search for potentially missing evidence
