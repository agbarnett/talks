# 2024 Great Debate: Quantitative research is better than qualitative

You can't argue with the numbers. And a number you can't argue with is the p-value, a number that instantly tells us whether effects are real or not. A number that tells us what research is good quality. There's nothing like this in qualitative research. Instead they waste time thinking about their results, whereas us quantitative people have a simple and universal arbitrar of truth.

And look at how good we are getting at p-values with these data from PubMed. Only 10% of results are not statistically significant, almost everything we trial is effective thanks to p-values. And we are brilliant at getting p-values just below the 0.05 threshold, not because we are endlessly re-analysing our data, oh no, it's because our years of experience and technical expertise mean we know what will work before we even run the experiment. 

Does it matter than most researchers cannot correctly define a p-value or confidence interval? Firmly no. The system is more important here than the persiflage of language. We'll leave that endless debate around wording and definitions to our qualitative colleagues. 

We have amazing graphics that qualitative research does not. Pie charts, Bar charts, 3d bar charts, 3d pie charts. We are literally in another dimension to our qualitative colleagues.

We have amazing new methods that our qualitative colleagues do not. Does it matter that most of them are not actually new, and were invented before anyone had heard the phrase "machine learning"? Firmly no. We are simply cleverer than are qualitative colleagues at branding, and that's born out in the funding. Simply add the phrase "machine learning" on your paper or grant application and watch what happens. Am I worried that people who don't understand a t-test or chi-squared test are now using machine learning? Firmly no, these super "new" methods are so sophisticated that it does not matter if you don't understand them, they will still give great answers. And if they don't give great answers, there are literally hundreds of assumptions that you can tweak to get a better answer. Soon we will have conquered all p-values above 0.05. 

I say that you can't argue with the numbers, and we have lots of numbers. Here's a great example, presenting mean ages to two decimal places. Does it matter than the second decimal place is less than a week and is essentially a random number? Firmly no. Even though these 75 year olds have been on the planet for over 3,900 weeks, these researchers appreciate that every week counts.

Quantitative researchers are smashing it in predictions models. We now have over 85,000 published prediction models. Soon every disease will have hundreds of prediction models; the number of models is easily beating the number of diseases. Even those diseases that are inherently stochastic and unpredictable, us quantative people do not let that fact get in our way. 

And what predictions do I have for quantitatve research? I think we will embrace a robotic future whilst our qualitative colleagues continue to rely on the antiquated ideas of thoughts and experience. And we are already leading the way. Here's the web site of North Metropolitan Health Service in WA, you can see they recommend a tool to help you choose a test. No need for any human statistician any more. And what if they call it a static app instead of a statistics app? That does not matter, as soon there'll be no need for statisticians, whereas static will always be important. And does it matter that this tool gives the wrong advice about what tests to use? Firmly no. The wrong advice is now more popular than the right advice, hence the wrong advice is actually right. 

And it was churlish of me to highlight a spelling mistake, because these mistakes are common. For examine, here's a JAMA paper using "statically significant", and here's the trend in spelling errors showing the growing popularity of "statically significant". Is it a problem that we are literally seeing more casual inference rather than causal inference? Firmly no. This is the way language changes, for example "awful" used to have positive connotations as it meant something that filled you with awe. So these new phrases may now be classed as errors, but will soon be the norm and will likely be reinforced by the wonderfully derivative chatgpt. So I look forward to seeing more "reserach". 

In conclusion, you can't argue with the numbers. Whilst our qualitative colleagues argue amongst themselves with endless debates and viewpoints, we have the numbers to settle all arguments.

If you didn't like my support for quantitative research, then don't worry, I'm one of only a handful of statisticians left and I am well over half-way through my career. Soon you wont have to even ignore my advice as it wont even be there. Instead we'll see the quantitative world driven forward by people with fresh ideas. Like clinicians who've read about statistics on the internet. Or possibly we'll even see statisticians replaced by the algorithms they invented. Chef's kiss.
