## The journey

* "Success isn’t only about getting a priority research topic funded" 

* "Taking part in a James Lind Alliance priority setting partnership can also transform the people, the research culture and the organisations involved"

* “Research is so often about competition, when working together could be so much more effective"

## Literature reviews

* Thanks to Sharon Sanders from Bond University

* Aimed to see what evidence was already published

* "Research on research" is a relatively new field with few specific funding schemes - hence not an enormous volume of work for any question

* no up-to-date, reliable systematic reviews of research evidence addressing the uncertainty exist

## Conditional lotteries

### Two related questions

* Would a lottery be fairer and more efficient without reducing quality?

* How much is enough effort for applying + judging application efforts, before a random lottery-style allocation becomes just as good as further adjudication?

## Bad publicity

## Political difficulties

* "Some critics have been suggesting that peer review is just too much hard work and perhaps a lottery would be better. Mind you this is a suggestion from economists, so take that any way you want." Warwick Anderson, NHMRC CEO, 2015

# Equal allocation 

:::: columns

:::{.column width="72%"}

<small>What if we got rid of competitive funding schemes but provide a set amount of research funds to each eligible researcher. Would the quality of work/innovation be equal or better than the current system (the time and effort saved from writing, submitting, reviewing grants would go towards doing the actual research?</small>

## Fatal flaw?

* "An alternative distribution system that significantly reduces
bureaucracy is to give every scientist a small amount of base
funding. However, the problem then becomes how to define
eligible scientists."

* Could pilot at a university?

* Early results from experiment at _Volkswagen Foundation_ with _RoRi_:
  - 85% find the distributed peer review process suitable
  - 77% believe it will identify appropriate reviewers
  - 74% trust it to be fair and to fund the best research

* Avoids time and difficulty of finding suitable reviewers
