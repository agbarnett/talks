*Title*: Evidence of statistical 'hacking' in clinical prediction models

*ABSTRACT*: Clinical prediction models are widely used in health and medical research. The area under the receiving operating curve (AUC) is a frequently used estimate to describe the utility of a clinical prediction model. The AUC is often interpreted relative to thresholds, with “good” or “excellent” models defined at 0.7, 0.8 or 0.9. These thresholds may create targets that result in “hacking”, where researchers are spurred on to re-analyze their data until they achieve a “good” result.

We extracted AUC values from PubMed abstracts to look for evidence of hacking. The distribution of 306,888 AUC values showed clear excesses above the thresholds of 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9 and shortfalls below the thresholds. The AUCs for some models are over-inflated, which risks exposing patients to sub-optimal clinical decision-making. Greater modelling transparency is needed, including published protocols, and data and code sharing.
