## "I am female and don’t want to appear “weak”. Obvious career breaks such as childbirth, childcare or caring for a partner with cancer are fairly straight forward but other circumstances such as a breakdown could affect my reputation or bias the reviewers to think I would not be able to complete the project."

#### Annabel Sheehy (University Technology Sydney) “I started my PhD when my son was five weeks old. My oldest daughter was 10. I would start working at 10pm after his feed and work until 3 or 4am. Then I would go to sleep for a few hours and wake up take my daughter to school and then come home to nap if I could. During that time instead of being a midwifery lecturer I stopped that in order to get my PhD. After my son was born I also had another child when I was 40, she is my youngest of my three children. This is career disruption #101 !!!!!”
