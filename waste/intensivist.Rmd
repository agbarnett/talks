## Shock: Statisticians want more statistics!

[Lee et al](https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2019/211/10/biostatistics-fundamental-discipline-core-modern-health-data-science) (2019) "Biostatistics: a fundamental discipline at the core of modern health data science" _MJA_

* "Without investment in biostatistics [...] the entire Australian medical research enterprise is at considerable risk of drowning in data but starving for knowledge."

--

McCullough JPA, Lipman J, Presneill JJ (2018) "The statistical curriculum within randomized controlled trials in critical illness" _Crit Care Med_ 

* "In-depth training in the assumptions and limitations of these current and emerging biostatistical methods may not be practically achievable for most clinicians, making accessible specialist biostatistical support an asset to evidence-based clinical practice."

--

#### Commentary: 

* "As much as clinicians love to hate statistics, understanding statistics turns out to be one of those things that can matter at the bedside."

* "Consider how often presenters, whether at morning conference or international meetings, hand-wave through statistical procedures."

Broman & Woo (2017) "Data Organization in Spreadsheets"

* Write dates as YYYY-MM-DD
* Do not leave any cells empty
* Put just one thing in a cell
* Organize the data as a single rectangle (subjects = rows, variables = columns)
* Use a single header row
* Create a data dictionary
* Do not include calculations in the raw data files
* Do not use font color or highlighting as data
* Choose good names for things
* Make backups
